<h2 id="what-is-hema-nelson">What is HEMA Nelson?</h2>

<p>We are a small group of enthusiasts located in Nelson, New Zealand, who study Historical European Martial Arts&mdash;also known as <abbr class="smcaps" title="Historical European Martial Arts">HEMA</abbr>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-hema">So what is&hellip; &ldquo;HEMA&rdquo;?</h2>

<p><abbr class="smcaps" title="Historical European Martial Arts">HEMA</abbr> encompasses fencing, stick-fighting, dagger, and wrestling, or any other martial art that has come out of Europe, from the middle ages until roughly the 1800's. If there is a treatises, fight book, or manual that covers it, then it can be studied. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_European_martial_arts">For a more in-depth look at <abbr class="smcaps" title="Historical European Martial Arts">HEMA</abbr>, you may read the wikipedia article</a>.</p>

<p><abbr class="smcaps" title="Historical European Martial Arts">HEMA</abbr> is not <span class="smcaps">LARP</span>ing, Stage Combat, or re-enactment. This is not to say we don't enjoy these things, but <abbr class="smcaps" title="Historical European Martial Arts">HEMA</abbr> is more of a martial art or sport than they are.</p>

<p>The NY Times has a great introductory video that was filmed at an American <abbr class="smcaps" title="Historical European Martial Arts">HEMA</abbr> tournament, known as LongPoint:</p>

<h3 id="#study">What disciplines do you study?</h3>

<p>Currently we mainly study 14th century German longsword in the style of Johannes Liechtenauer, focusing on the DÃ¶bringer, Ringeck, and Danzig manuals. You can <a href="http://wiktenauer.com/wiki/Johannes_Liechtenauer">read more about Liechtenauer on Wiktenauer</a>.</p>

<p>However, we are open to studying any of many disciplines under <abbr class="smcaps" title="Historical European Martial Arts">HEMA</abbr>. We encourage everyone in our group to take the lead on researching any particular style that interests them. They can then teach this to the rest of the group.</p>

<h2 id="join-us">I'd like to give this ago, can I join you?</h2>

<p>Yes, we are always looking for new people to come along. We are not an offical club, yet. We do not have memberships. We do try and meet regularly, mostly on the weekends. We are group of friends that are doing this out of fun and to keep active. Ultimately, with enough interest, we do intend on making this into an offical club.</p>

<h3 id="contact-us">How do I contact you?</h3>

<p>We are on <a href="https://twitter.com/hemanelson">twitter as @hemanelson</a> or you can <a href="mailto:hello@hemanelson.com">email us at hello@hemanelson.com</a>.</p>

<h3 id="safety">Safety Disclaimer</h3>

<p>We hit each other with swords. If you want to join us there is a high chance that you will also get hit by a sword. We <em>occasionally</em> leave with <strike>badges</strike> bruises. But, in all seriousness safety is extreamly important to us: we ensure that everyone has the correct safety gear before training and that no one is pushed to a level that they feel uncomfortable with.</p>
